# Foundation-Hosted Projects

![PyTorch Ecosystem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/pytorch/0d4cedaa47c7ee22042eb24e87eb3cfe95502404/docs/source/_static/img/pytorch-logo-dark.svg)

This repository is designed to allow projects seeking to join the umbrella foundation as officially hosted projects to submit their applications. It is still a work in progress and we welcome PRs on this repo to automate assignments, improve the process, etc.  
For information on the process please check out the [details on our application process below](#how-applications-are-reviewed).  

Please review the [Hosted Projects review process](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/tac/blob/main/docs/governance/PyTorch_Ecosystem_Process.md) to ensure that you meet the minimum expectations before applying.  

> ⚠️ This process is a working draft adapted from the ecosystem project intake. Updates will follow once the hosted project intake process is officially ratified.

# How to apply

Applying is as easy as 1-2-3!

1. Open a new [Hosted Project Application](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ecosystem/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New&projects=&template=application.yml&title=%3CProject+Name%3E) using the linked issue form.
2. Complete all sections.
3. Submit the issue.

## What's next?

Once you have submitted your issue, your project's application is placed in the project backlog for triaging. You can view the status of your application and others at any time by checking out our [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/pytorch-fdn/projects/6/views/1).

As the community approaches review meetings, PyTorch staff will move applications to the "in-progress" column on the Project Board. At this point, members of the PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group will ask questions, seek to learn more, and make a decision on the project.  

Be sure to check your project issue periodically to see if the PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group has asked questions or for more information in the issue.

### Community Comments on Applications

The PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group welcomes and appreciates community members' support and exploration in surfacing items for technical consideration during the application process. This allows the Working Group to develop a more comprehensive understanding of each project's potential.

---

### Review Meeting

When the PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group meets to review applications, your application will be pulled up and discussed. Your application may receive one of several status labels, as defined below.

## How applications are reviewed

### Frequency

The PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group reviews applications on a first-come, first-served basis. It may take several months before an application is reviewed, depending on community leadership availability.  

### Quantity

The Working Group attempts to review approximately 7–10 applications per session. Every project is unique and may require varying levels of discussion depending on its nature and maturity.

### Review Order

Applications are traditionally reviewed in FIFO (First In, First Out) order based on issue number, except for `Returning` or previously `Postponed` applications, which are prioritized accordingly.

### Discussions

During the review session, the Working Group will assess the application, ask questions, and provide feedback. Comments outlining required improvements or blockers will be added directly to the issue.

---

## Voting

The PyTorch Ecosystem Working Group votes on project acceptance using a simple majority — one vote per member.

---

## Acceptance or Decline 

After voting, the application will be labeled as `Approved` or `Declined`. Comments will include reasoning and any further guidance.

---

## Decline and Reapplication

Projects that are declined may reapply once they have addressed the feedback provided in the issue discussion.
