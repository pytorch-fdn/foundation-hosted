# PyTorch Foundation-Hosted Project

![PyTorch Ecosystem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/pytorch/0d4cedaa47c7ee22042eb24e87eb3cfe95502404/docs/source/_static/img/pytorch-logo-dark.svg)

This repository is designed to support open source projects applying to become **foundation-hosted projects** under the PyTorch Foundation. It outlines the intake process, requirements, and governance path for projects seeking Platform or Vertical status within the PyTorch landscape.

Please review the [Foundation-Hosted Project Lifecycle documentation](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/foundation-hosted-project/blob/main/governance/foundation-hosted-project-process.md) before submitting an application.

> **Important:** Before applying to become a Foundation-Hosted Project, your project must already be an approved [PyTorch Ecosystem Project](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/tac/blob/main/docs/governance/PyTorch_Ecosystem_Process.md).  
> Please ensure you have completed the Ecosystem application and approval process before proceeding.

## How to Apply

Applying is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. Open a new [Foundation-Hosted Project Application](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/foundation-hosted/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New&projects=&template=application.yml&title=%3CProject+Name%3E) using the linked issue form.
2. Complete all required sections.
3. Submit the issue.

Your application will appear on the [Foundation Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/pytorch-fdn/projects/10/views/1), where its progress can be tracked.

---

## What's Next?

Once submitted:
- Your application is placed in the backlog for triage.
- A **voting member of the TAC** must sponsor your project.
- You’ll prepare a review presentation, with help from PyTorch Foundation staff.
- Your project will be scheduled for a future TAC meeting, where it will be reviewed.

Projects should monitor their submission and respond promptly to comments or requests from the TAC or community.

---

## Review and Voting

Project applications are reviewed and voted on by the **PyTorch Technical Advisory Council (TAC)**.

- Projects are reviewed during scheduled TAC meetings.
- To be accepted, a project must receive a **2/3 majority vote** by the TAC.
- The TAC will classify the project as either a **Platform** or **Vertical** project.
